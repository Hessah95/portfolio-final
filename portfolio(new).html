		<h2><br>I got a work experience in a counseling center for approximately 7 months. Although it was different from my field, I learned a lot of things through it. I treated with different types of personalities. In the beginning, I found it difficult to deal with them,
		but by the time it became easier and more interesting. The greatest lesson that I learned from this experience is to not judge people unless you hear and understand them very well because each one has his reason.</h2>

		<h2><br>It is good to expand our knowledge in different fields. I attended a CPR workshop, it contained a lot of valuable information, but as a practical part it was not easy :P.
		Also, I am interested in how can we help nature, so I joined the environmental club in high school and participated in several exhibitions and activities.
		Speaking of high school, in grade 12 I participated in the talent show and got the 3rd rank reward ^_^.
		I like music also, and I tried to play the violin in high school and piano in university. Really I agree that the stringed instruments are much more difficult than the other ones :'(</h2>
